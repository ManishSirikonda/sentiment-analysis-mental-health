# Sentiment Analysis for Mental Health

![Mental Health](https://images.inc.com/uploaded_files/image/1920x1080/shutterstock_619960997_360000.jpg)

Mental health is a critical aspect of overall well-being, and understanding the nuances of mental health conditions can provide timely support and interventions. This project performs sentiment analysis on textual data to predict the mental health status of individuals based on their statements. By analyzing the language used, we can infer emotional and mental well-being indicators.

## Project Overview

This project uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to analyze the sentiment expressed in text data. By processing and classifying text data, the project aims to:
- Identify patterns in mental health-related statements.
- Predict sentiment polarity (positive, negative, neutral).
- Provide insights into potential mental health conditions.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stopword removal, and text normalization.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing key trends and patterns.
- **Model Training**: Utilizing machine learning algorithms like Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, or deep learning approaches.
- **Evaluation**: Assessment of model accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Visualization**: Graphical representations of results and insights.

## Data

The project utilizes a dataset containing textual data, with labels indicating the sentiment or mental health condition. The data is preprocessed and split into training and testing sets to build robust models.

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook in your preferred environment, such as Jupyter Lab or Google Colab.
2. Execute each cell sequentially to:
   - Preprocess the data (e.g., tokenization, stopword removal, text normalization).
   - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize trends.
   - Train and evaluate machine learning models.
   - Visualize the results and gain insights.
3. Modify the code to experiment with:
   - Different datasets.
   - Alternative models or preprocessing techniques.
4. Export or save results for further analysis or reporting.

## Results

The models demonstrated the ability to predict sentiment and potential mental health conditions accurately. Below are the key performance metrics (example values shown, replace with actual metrics):

- **Accuracy**: 85%
- **Precision**: 82%
- **Recall**: 78%
- **F1-Score**: 80%

Visualizations, such as confusion matrices and performance graphs, are available in the notebook to provide deeper insights into the results.
